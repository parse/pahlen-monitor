# SyncOrSwim

Sync your pool data or swim alone! Monitor your pool dosing units and share generic Home Assistant sensors with your neighbors using a central backend.

## Features
- **Producer Role:** Captures images from a camera and sends them to the backend for analysis. Also shares selected generic sensors with consumers.
- **Consumer Role:** Polls the shared backend for the latest pool status and shared sensors.
- **Generic Sensor Sharing:** Share any Home Assistant sensor (e.g., cellar temperature) with a consumer installation.
- **Computer Vision Analysis:** Recognizes LED patterns to determine dosing vs. measurement modes and error states.
- **Status Sensors:** Provides detailed sensors for pool chemistry.
- **Problem Detection:** Binary sensor for dosing problems and data staleness.

## Requirements
- Home Assistant ≥ 2024.4.1
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
- (Optional) Camera pointed at dosing units
- (Optional) Spotlight/Light entity for night-time analysis
- Backend server (Python/FastAPI)

## Quality Gates
The repository's validation workflow runs:
- `ruff check custom_components backend scripts`
- `ruff format --check custom_components backend scripts`
- `mypy backend/src custom_components/sync_or_swim`
- `python scripts/generate_api_types.py --check`
- `pytest`
- HACS validation
- hassfest validation

## Installation

### 1. Install Integration
1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS.
2. Install the "SyncOrSwim" integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Migrating from Pahlen Monitor
The Home Assistant integration domain changed from `pahlen_monitor` to
`sync_or_swim`. Existing Home Assistant entities from the old integration are
not preserved.

1. Delete the old "Pahlen Monitor" integration entry from Home Assistant.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Install or update this repository through HACS.
4. Add a new "SyncOrSwim" integration entry and reselect the camera, light,
   shared sensors, backend URL, token, and installation ID.

## Backend Flow
- Producers send data to the backend via analysis bursts or direct sensor pushes.
- Consumers poll the latest state for an installation ID.

### 2. Configuration
- **Producer:** Select "Producer". Configure your camera (optional), shared sensors, backend URL, and token.
- **Consumer:** Select "Consumer". Configure the backend URL, token, and the installation ID to follow.

## Entities
Shared sensors are automatically discovered and created on the consumer side with full metadata (units, device classes).
